# Archive

This folder collects legacy artifacts and deprecated scripts from the old PHP implementation and earlier deployment flow. Items can be safely moved here without impacting the new TS/Node backend.

Planned moves (tracked incrementally):
- application/ (legacy PHP app)
- phpdocker/ (legacy PHP Docker setup)
- scripts: update_daily.sh, update_daily_local.sh, getcovers.sh, linux-installer.sh, manage_nodejs.sh
- nginx_cookies.txt, cookies.txt, cookies_direct.txt, persistent_cookies.txt (legacy helpers)

Do not delete immediately; keep for reference until the new stack is fully validated.
